Therefore, the test runs in any modern web browser and allows an easy distribution of the test environment to a significant amount of participants in combination with simple configuration. Currently it supports ABX and MUSHRA style test procedures but can be easily extended to other test schemes.\r\n\r\nTo get a better impression about its functionality there are two demo test sites for the ABX and MUSHRA test classes:\r\n\r\n* http://hsu-ant.github.io/beaqlejs/demo/abx/\r\n* http://hsu-ant.github.io/beaqlejs/demo/mushra/\r\n\r\nBeaqleJS has been presented at the [Linux Audio Conference 2014](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/) at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany. The [paper](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/papers/26.pdf) and presentation [slides](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/download/SKraft_BeaqleJS.pdf) are available from the conference archive.\r\n\r\nIf you want to cite BeaqleJS in a publication please use\r\n\r\n    S.

Download the test scripts\r\n   - you can either clone the git repository `git clone https://github.com/HSU-ANT/beaqlejs.git`\r\n   - or simply download a zip of the current HEAD revision at `https://github.com/HSU-ANT/beaqlejs/archive/master.zip`\r\n   - or choose an older release at `https://github.com/HSU-ANT/beaqlejs/releases`\r\n\r\n2. Uncomment the line where the desired test class is initialized and loaded in the header of the `index.html` file.\r\n\r\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n            var testHandle;\r\n            window.onload=function() {\r\n                // Uncomment one of the following lines to choose the desired test class\r\n                //testHandle = new MushraTest(TestConfig);  // <= MUSHRA test class\r\n                //testHandle = new AbxTest(TestConfig);     // <= ABX test class\r\n            };\r\n        </script>\r\n\r\n3. Prepare a config file and set its path in the prepared `<script></script>` tag in the header of the `index.html` file.\r\n\r\n        <!-- load the test config file -->\r\n            <script src=\"config/YOUR_CONFIG.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n        <!---->\r\n    Two example config files for the MUSHRA and ABX test class are already supplied in the `config/` folder to serve as a starting point. Detailed information about the different test classes and configuration can be found below.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n## Test Configuration ##\r\n\r\n### General Options ###\r\n\r\nThe available options can be dividided into a set of general options whitch apply to all test classes and other options, including file declarations, that are specific for a single test class.\r\n\r\n    var TestConfig = {\r\n        \"TestName\": \"My Listening Test\",     // <=  Name of the test\r\n        \"LoopByDefault\": true,               // <=  Enable looped playback by default\r\n        \"ShowFileIDs\": false,                // <=  Show file IDs for debugging (never enable this during real test!)\r\n        \"ShowResults\": false,                // <=  Show table with test results at the end\r\n        \"EnableABLoop\": true,                // <=  Show controls to loop playback with an AB range slider\r\n        \"EnableOnlineSubmission\": false,     // <=  Enable transmission of JSON encoded results to a web service\r\n        \"BeaqleServiceURL\": \"\",              // <=  URL of the web service\r\n        \"SupervisorContact\": \"\",             // <=  Email address of supervisor to contact for help or for submission of results by email\r\n        \"RandomizeTestOrder\": true,          // <=  Present test sets in a random order\r\n        \"MaxTestsPerRun\": -1,                // <=  Only run a random subset of all available tests, set to -1 to disable\r\n        \"Testsets\": [ {...}, {...}, ... ],   // <=  Definition of test sets and files, more details below\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### ABX ###\r\n\r\nIn an ABX test three items named A, B and X are presented to the listener, whereas X is randomly selected to be either the same as A or B. The listener has to identify which item is hidden behind X, or which one (A or B) is closest to X. If the listener is able to find the correct item, it reveals that there are perceptual differences between A and B. \r\n\r\nA typical application of ABX tests would be the evaluation of the transparency of audio codecs. For example item A could be an unencoded audio snippet and B is the same snippet but encoded with a lossy codec. When the listener is not able to identify if A or B was hidden in X (results are randomly distributed), one can assume that the audio coding was transparent\r\n    \r\n    ...                                      // <=  General options\r\n    \"Testsets\": [\r\n        { \"Name\": \"Schubert\",                // <=  Name of the test set\r\n          \"TestID\": \"id1_1\",                 // <=  Unique test set ID, necessary for internal\r\n          \"Files\": {                         // <=  Array with test files\r\n            \"A\": \"audio/schubert_ref.wav\",   // <=  File A\r\n            \"B\": \"audio/schubert_2.wav\",     // <=  File B\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        { ... },                             // <=  Next test set starts here\r\n        ....\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n### MUSHRA ###\r\n\r\nIn a MUSHRA test (ITU-R BS.1116-1) the listener gets presented an item marked as reference together with several anonymous test items. By using a slider for each test item he has to rate how close the items are to the reference on top. Among the test items there is usually also one hidden reference and one, or several, anchor signals to prove the validity of the ratings and the qualification of the participants.\r\n\r\nContrary to ABX tests the MUSHRA procedure allows more detailed evaluations as it is possible to compare more than one algorithm to a reference. Furthermore, the results are on a continuous scale allowing a direct numerical comparison of all algorithms under test.\r\n\r\n    ...                                      // <=  General options\r\n    \"RateMinValue\": 0,                       // <=  Minimum rating\r\n    \"RateMaxValue\": 100,                     // <=  Maximum rating\r\n    \"RateDefaultValue\":0,                    // <=  Default rating\r\n    \"Testsets\": [\r\n        { \"Name\": \"Schubert 1\",              // <=  Name of the test set\r\n          \"TestID\": \"id1_1\",                 // <=  Unique test set ID, necessary for internal referencing\r\n          \"Files\": {                         // <=  Array with test files\r\n            \"Reference\": \"audio/ref.wav\",    // <=  Every MUSHRA test set needs exactly one(!) file with a \"Reference\" label\r\n            \"label_1\": \"audio/algo_1.wav\",   // <=  Various files to be tested, the labels can be freely chosen as desired\r\n            \"label_2\": \"audio/algo_2.wav\",   //      but have to be unique inside a test set\r\n            \"label_3\": \"audio/algo_3.wav\",   //      ...\r\n            \"anchor\": \"audio/algo_anch.wav\", //      ...\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        { ... },                             // <=  Next test set starts here\r\n        ....\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n## Browser Support ##\r\n\r\nBeaqleJS in general will run well in any recent web browsers out in the wild. The only noteworthy exceptions are the Internet Explorer versions below 9 which still have a market share of a few percent and unfortunately miss the required FileAPI. Participants will get a warning if they open the listening test with one of these old versions.\r\n\r\n### HTML5 Features ###\r\n\r\n* Audio playback using HTML5 is widely supported by all major browsers since many years (except IE below version 9.0). ([list browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio))\r\n\r\n* FileAPI-Blob is necessary to provide the listening test results as a virtual download to be saved on the local harddisk. This API can be expected to be available in every browser of the last years  (except IE below version 9.0). ([list browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=blobbuilder))\r\n\r\nOptionally:\r\n\r\n* WebAudioAPI is used in BeaqleJS for smooth fade in/out at start/stop of playback and at the loop borders. It currently only works reliably with browsers based on the Chromium engine, although it is available in every major browser apart from the Internet Explorer. ([list browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api))\r\n\r\n### Codecs ###\r\n\r\nAlthough most browsers today support the HTML5 `<audio>` tag, the supported formats and codecs vary a lot. Unfortunately no browser directly supports FLAC or other lossless compression so far. The only lossless, but also uncompressed, format widely accepted is WAV PCM with 16 bit sample precision. Solely the Internet Explorer is not capable to play back this file type.\r\n\r\nFormat     |  IE   | Firefox | Chrome |  Opera | Safari\r\n-----------|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------\r\nWAV PCM    |  no   |  > 3.5  |  yes   | > 11.0 | > 3.1\r\nOgg Vorbis |  no   |  > 3.5  |  yes   | > 10.5 | XiphQT\r\nMP3        | > 9.0 |  > 26*  |  yes   | > 14   | > 3.1\r\nACC        | > 9.0 |  > 26*  |  yes   | > 14   | > 3.1\r\n\r\n(* not on Mac OS X)\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n## Online Submission ##\r\n\r\nBeaqleJS can send the test results in JSON format to a web service to collect them in a central place. An example server side PHP script which can be used to receive and store the results is included in the `web_service/` subfolder. It only requires a webspace with PHP version 5.\r\n\r\n### Setup ###\r\n\r\n1. Upload the file `web_service/beaqleJS_Service.php` to a webserver. Create a folder named `results/` next to the PHP script and make sure that the webserver has write permissions on it.\r\n\r\n2. Try to execute the script in your browser. For example, point your browser to `http://yourdomain.com/mysubfolder/beaqleJS_Service.php`. The script performs a self-test and checks PHP version and write permission of the `results/` folder.\r\n\r\n3. Enable online submission in the BeaqleJS config (`\"EnableOnlineSubmission\": false`) and set the `BeaqleServiceURL` to `http://yourdomain.com/mysubfolder/beaqleJS_Service.php`.\r\n\r\n### Security ###\r\n\r\nAs with every public web service it is important to be aware about security aspects. In the current implementation there is no possibility to authenticate submitters, therefore everyone can potentially submit spoofed results if he is able to do some basic reverse engineering!\r\n\r\nHowever, there are two provisions to avoid spamming of your sever:\r\n\r\n* The results JSON object is limited to a size of 64kB which is a lot for listening test results, but not enough to abuse your server as a hosting facility\r\n* File names in the `results/` folder contain a random string, so it is not possible to access the submitted data without listing the whole directory\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n## Contact ##\r\n\r\nhttp://hsu-ant.github.io/beaqlejs\r\n\r\nskraft (AT) hsu-hh.de\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThe complete sources, html and script files as well as images are released unter the *GPLv3 \r\nlicense*.
